# Hi there ðŸ‘‹ I'm Eduardo Link

- ðŸ”­ I'm currently working at P3DMed creating applications focused on medical imaging (mostly using C++ for Desktop applications and NodeJS on the backend)
- :rocket: I'm currently learning ReactJS and React-Native at [Rocketseat](https://github.com/Rocketseat) 
- ðŸŒ± There's nothing that can't be accomplished through technology and coding, it's just a matter of how long and how far you're willing to take it!
- âš¡Fun fact: People call me "Link" as it is my actual last name! (not because of the video game character, though I really like [old] games)
